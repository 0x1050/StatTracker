# Questions
We are limited in how many questions we can ask the students.
As such, I think it would be best to ask questions in a dynamic manner based on what the student's like/dislike about each individual project.
In order to do this, we will first ask the students for one thing that they like and dislike about each project.
These two questions will be categorical and have the same answers.
I'm thinking the three categories should be:
- If the project looks professional/well designed (visual)
- If the project is implemented well (technology)
- If the project is useful (creative/usable)
---
Upon receiving feedback about what category each individual likes and dislikes, we will serve them questions based on their original choice.
This will ensure that each group receives not only feedback that tells them what they did good, but also what they are lacking.
This way, will make all criticism of the project appear more constructive and won't be a bummer when they receive their group reviews.

After the second round of questions, I want to have the students provide written feedback as well.
The feedback will be free-form and answer two questions:
- Do you feel you can make a similar project with the things that you have learned in this class?(This will be presented to the professor)
- Do you have any comments for the group that just finished presenting? (This is of course for the students)

Below you will find the original questions
