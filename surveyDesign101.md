# Survey Design 101
## What is the purpose?

- list goals
- list hypotheses

## 4 types of question/answer styles

### Categorical/Nominal

These are questions such that ask "Which do you think is the best choice?"
- They are the easiest data to analyze
- They cannot answer "how much?"

### Ordinal (never...always, disagree...agree)
- Also called Likert scales, they present answers in the form of:

| Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Neutral    | Agree | Strongly Agree |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------    | ----- | -------------- |
| Strongly Dislike  | Dislike  | Don't Care | Like  | Like A Lot     |

- The data collected through this typo of questionnaire cannot be averaged. This is due to the fact that if half the surveyed people strongly disagree and the other half strongly agree, then it would appear that everyone is neutral. Instead of averaging, we can use frequency charts.
- The order in which the answers are laid out is very important and can skew, the results. To avoid this, we switch the direction that they go in for each individual user.
- It is important to keep each user's experience the same throughout in order to not confuse them and skew the data, because of this, we will have to keep track of which direction a particular user's answers are in

### Interval Data
- This type of data has to be ordered, and distance has to have meaning.
- This is useful for obtaining segmentation data.

### Ratio Data

- This is the richest form of data available
- None of some is valid (ie: 0)
- It is possible to represent responses as fractions
- Averages and variances are valid only with this type of data

## Phrasing
- Avoid leading questions and presuppositions
- Allow for neutral/NA responses where applicable
- Avoid compound questions
- Use simple language
- Randomize answers

## Analysis of Survey Results

### Categorical
- Calculate total number of responses, divide by total
- Group results by user segment, eg:
    - visual
    - technical
    - conceptual
- Use contingency tables, here is an example:
|        | Dog | Cat | Total |
| ---    | --- | --- | ----- |
| Male   | 42  | 10  | 52    |
| Female | 9   | 39  | 48    |
| Total  | 51  | 49  | 100   |

### Ordinal Data

- **DO NOT** average!
- Use a frequency table
- Diverging bar charts are also a good option for this type of data

### Interval

- Averages and standard deviations can be used only if intervals are evenly spaced

### Ratio Data

- You can run pretty much any type of test on this type of data

## Interpretation of results

- Respect the survey's limits of precision, round numbers where necessary
- Tables are useful for precise numbers, or for a few comparisons
