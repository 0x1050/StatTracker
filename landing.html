        <h1>Welcome to StatTracker</h1>
        <h2>It's nice to meet you, User.</h2><br>
        <p>This is just a template page. It includes all
           of the elements that we would pobably use to
           in the presentation of our project. I think the
           best idea would be to create separate css files
           with different theme names, and have javascript
           get rid of the current one and import the new one
           with asynchronously when we chose the name of it
           from the submenu up top.</p>
        <p>Although the actual pages that we create for the
           project will be a lot less simpler than what we
           have here, this gives us a good foundation to
           build upon. I would recommend checking out
           <a href="www.fonts.google.com">fonts.google.com</a>
            for different fonts to use. The easiest way to use
            them is to click on the top where it says to use the
            old style. This allows you to add fonts to a stylesheet.
            After you choose your fonts, you can click on where it
            says "#fonts selected" and grab the address in the <code>href</code>.
            Pasting this address into your url will allow you to copy
            the entire css file. From here, the best thing to do is
            to create a file within the css folder of the project
            with the name in the form of [themename]fonts.css. This
            will allow you to use <code>@import url("[themename]fonts.css</code>
            within your css file. Or you can just paste it in. Whatever you want.
        </p>
        <p>Besides that, you can check <a href="w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>
           if you need help with learning basic CSS. Their tutorials are pretty
           simple, but contain the essential concepts you would need to brush up
           on CSS. I personally love this website, since it is where I learned HTML
           and CSS many years ago. You can also learn JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP
           there as well. I can't stress enough how awesome this site is.</p>
        <p>Depending on how deep you want to go into front-end, There are
        <strong>tons</strong> of other really awesome resources. Here's a list</p>

            <tr>

        <p>That's just a few, but this is a living document, so I can lways add more, and
           so can you if you have a good resource. The only thing I ask is that we
           coordinate if we are to modify this page. That way we don't run into issues
           when we try to merge our forks.</p>
